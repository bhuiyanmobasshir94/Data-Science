# Data Science Base
Showcasing of my data science research, experiment and development

While working with data science in remote server I usually use jupyter notebook and vscode separately with ssh tunneling
For vscode with port `8080`
```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8882:localhost:8080 uname@ip
```
For jupyter notebook with port `8888`
```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8881:localhost:8888 uname@ip
```
