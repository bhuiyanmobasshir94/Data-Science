# Data Science

> Data Science works and best practices are listed in this repository. Either pipeline, networks and libraries all are included.

While working with data science in remote server I usually use jupyter notebook and vscode separately with ssh tunneling
For vscode with port `8080`
```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8882:localhost:8080 uname@ip
```
For jupyter notebook with port `8888`
```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8881:localhost:8888 uname@ip
```
Kaggle [API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)

To make kaggle api key not readable to other users 
```
chmod 600 /home/user/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```
