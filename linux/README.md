While working with data science in remote server I usually use jupyter notebook and vscode separately with ssh tunneling

For vscode with port `8080`
```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8882:localhost:8080 uname@ip
```
For jupyter notebook with port `8888`

## How To Use Linux Screen for background task running
Ref: [Resource](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/)

The screen package is pre-installed on most Linux distros nowadays. You can check if it is installed on your system by typing:
```
screen --version
```
If you donâ€™t have screen installed on your system, you can easily install it using the package manager of your distro.
Install Linux Screen on Ubuntu and Debian:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install screen
```
#### Detach from Linux Screen Session
You can detach from the screen session at any time by typing:
```
Ctrl+a d
```
The program running in the screen session will continue to run after you detach from the session.

#### Reattach to a Linux Screen
To resume your screen session use the following command:
```
screen -r [id]
```
In case you have multiple screen sessions running on your machine, you will need to append the screen session ID after the `r`switch.

To find the session ID list the current running screen sessions with:
```
screen -ls
```
To kill session 
```
screen -XS <session-id> quit
```
To kill a process running in a port 
```
sudo kill -9 `sudo lsof -t -i:{PORT_NUMBER}`
```
